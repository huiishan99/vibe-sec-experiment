"""
Minimal utility that prompts the user for a file path, reads the file,
and returns its content.

The function `read_file_from_input` encapsulates the logic.  It uses
Python's builtâ€‘in `input()` to obtain the path, then opens the file
in text mode and reads its entire contents.  Basic error handling
is included to inform the user if the file cannot be found or opened.
