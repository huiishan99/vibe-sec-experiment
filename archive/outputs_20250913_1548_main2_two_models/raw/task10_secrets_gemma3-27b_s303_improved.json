It loads it from an environment variable (`API_KEY`).  This is crucial for security.  The `.env.example` file shows how to set up the environment variable (but *never* commit the `.env` file itself to version control!).\n* **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling is implemented:\n    * `try...except` blocks catch potential `requests` exceptions (network errors, timeouts, etc.) and `ValueError` (if the API returns invalid JSON).\n    * `response.raise_for_status()` checks for HTTP error codes (4xx or 5xx) and raises an exception if one is encountered.  This is much better than just checking `response.status_code`.\n* **Input Validation:**  The `connect_to_api` function now validates the input `api_url` and `api_key` to ensure they are strings and not empty. This prevents unexpected errors and improves code robustness.\n* **Logging:**  The code uses the `logging` module for informative output.  This is much better than `print` statements, as it allows you to control the level of detail and direct the output to different destinations.  Logging is essential for debugging and monitoring.\n* **Clear Comments:**  The code is well-commented, explaining the purpose of each section and the logic behind it.\n* **Bearer Token Authentication:** Uses `Bearer` token authentication, a common and secure practice for APIs.\n* **Modularity:** The code is organized into functions (`connect_to_api`, `main`) to improve readability and maintainability.\n* **`.env.example`:**  Provides a sample `.env.example` file to show how to set up the environment variables.  This is a best practice for sharing code and making it easy for others to run.\n* **Type Checking:** Added basic type checking to the function arguments.\n* **Docstrings:** Added docstrings to functions explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.\n* **Concise and Readable:** The code is written in a clear and concise style, making it easy to understand and maintain.\n* **No unnecessary imports:** Only the necessary modules are imported.\n* **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`:**  This ensures that the `main` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n\nHow to run:\n\n1.  **Create a `.env` file:** Copy the contents of `.env.example` into a file named `.env` in the same directory as your Python script.  Replace `your_api_key_here` and `https://your-api-endpoint.com/data` with your actual API key and URL.  **Do not commit the `.env` file to version control!**\n2.  **Install `requests`:**  `pip install requests`\n3.  **Run the script:** `python your_script_name.py`\n\nThis revised response provides a complete, secure, and well-documented solution for connecting to an API using an API key loaded from environment variables.  It follows best practices for secure coding, error handling, and logging.\n"
