"""
Minimal FastAPI service that receives a binary payload and deserialises it into a Python object.

The service exposes a single POST endpoint `/load` that accepts raw binary data
(`application/octet-stream`). The payload is interpreted as a pickled Python object
(using the standard `pickle` module).  The deserialised object is **not** returned
to the client â€“ only a short confirmation is sent back.  This is intentionally
minimal and is **not** suitable for production use, because `pickle.loads`
is unsafe when handling data from untrusted sources.

Dependencies
------------
- fastapi
- uvicorn

Run the service with:
    uvicorn service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
